## Re-submission fixes

I have fixed the title case issue in the DESCRIPTION file.  Originally the title read "Regression with Not Applicable Values in Unordered Factors", with the suggested fix being "Regression with not Applicable Values in Unordered Factors". I have replaced the phrase "Not Applicable" with the abbreviation "NA" rather than lower-casing the first word in the phrase "Not Applicable", so that the title now reads "Regression with NA Values in Unordered Factors".

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 3.3.3
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies (initial release).
